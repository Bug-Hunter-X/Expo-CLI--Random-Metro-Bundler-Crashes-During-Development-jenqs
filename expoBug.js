While using Expo CLI, I encountered an issue where the Metro bundler would intermittently fail to start, resulting in development server crashes. This occurred seemingly randomly, without any specific code changes or apparent triggers. The error messages were vague, often mentioning issues with resolving modules or encountering unexpected characters in the source code, but no clear root cause could be identified.  The project builds and runs successfully on other machines, making this seem like a local environment issue.
