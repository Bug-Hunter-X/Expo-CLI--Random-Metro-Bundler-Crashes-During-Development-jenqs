# Expo CLI: Random Metro Bundler Crashes

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered while using Expo CLI, where the Metro bundler would randomly crash during development.  The issue was intermittent and difficult to debug due to vague error messages. The project functions correctly on other machines, suggesting an issue with a local development environment.

The `expoBug.js` file contains example code that may (or may not) trigger the issue depending on your environment. The solution (`expoBugSolution.js`) explores potential fixes.
